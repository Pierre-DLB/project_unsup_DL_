        "In this Google Colab cell, we will be downloading two distinct datasets for a text style transfer task. The goal is to develop a model capable of translating text between the writing styles of William Shakespeare and a more modern English author. For this purpose, we have chosen two datasets:\n",
        "\n",
        "    Shakespeare's Complete Works: This dataset includes the entire collection of plays and poems written by William Shakespeare. Shakespeare's works represent early modern English with a rich and unique style, making them ideal for studying stylistic differences compared to contemporary English.\n",
        "\n",
        "    \"Pride and Prejudice\" by Jane Austen: As a representative of more modern English, we've chosen Jane Austen's famous novel \"Pride and Prejudice\". While not contemporary in the current sense, Austen's language is more aligned with modern English than Shakespeare's, yet it maintains a level of formality and complexity in its style. This contrast will provide a challenging yet insightful basis for the style transfer model.\n",
        "\n",
        "By downloading and utilizing these two datasets, we aim to explore the nuances of linguistic style transfer, particularly focusing on the transformation of syntactic and stylistic elements between the two distinct forms of English.\n",
        "\n",
        "The following script will download both datasets from Project Gutenberg, which is a reliable source for public domain texts:"
